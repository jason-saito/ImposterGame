WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING: 
📘 Imposter Game – Context & Experience Overview
What the Game Is
Imposter is a fast-paced, social bluffing game (inspired by Spyfall and the voting dynamics of Among Us) built to run like a Kahoot-style web experience.
* One person hosts the game on a shared screen (TV/projector/laptop).

* Everyone else joins using their phone through a simple game code.

* The game gives all players the same secret word except for one (or more) Imposters, who receive no word.

* Players must give clues about the word while trying not to reveal it outright.

* The Imposter tries to blend in by faking clues.

* After clues, players vote to identify the Imposter.

* The host screen dramatically reveals the result.

The goal is to keep the gameplay simple, fast, and social, letting players talk, debate, and laugh together—while the web app handles roles, clues, voting, and the reveal.

How the Game Should Feel (User Experience)
🎮 1. Kahoot-style joining
Visually, the game should feel as easy as joining a Kahoot or Jackbox game:
   * Large 6-digit game code on the host screen

   * Players join instantly from their phones via a URL

   * When they join, the host screen updates in real time

   * A lively, fun vibe—big bold text, animated transitions, smooth movement

The joining experience should be:
      * Zero friction

      * No account needed

      * No instructions needed (intuitive, obvious)

🎭 2. Dramatic role reveal
When the game starts:
Non-imposter’s screen:
         * Bold card saying “You are a Civilian”

         * Below that: the secret word

         * Clean, minimal UI so the word is unmistakable

Imposter’s screen:
            * Big bold card: “You are the Imposter.”

            * Subtext: “Try to blend in.”

This is a private reveal, so it feels personal and suspenseful.
BUT MAKE SURE THAT THIS SCREEN APPEARS ON THEIR DEVICE ONLY 
________________


📝 3. Clue-giving experience
Player screens should show:
               * A header reminding them of their role

               * If civilian: the secret word (large, centered)

               * If Imposter: “No word provided”

               * A text field: “Enter your clue”

               * A clear submit button

The host screen:
                  * Shows a list of players

                  * Optionally shows clues appears one by one (like Spyfall)

                  * Or keeps clues hidden until all are submitted

                  * A countdown timer may be shown

The tone should be:
                     * Clean, readable

                     * No distractions

                     * Emphasis on the clues

________________


🗣️ 4. Discussion phase
This phase involves real human conversation.
The UI should be minimal:
                        * Host screen: all clues visible

                        * Maybe a short countdown timer

                        * Player screens: simple message “Discuss your theories…”

No buttons needed except the host’s “Start Voting” button.
________________


🗳️ 5. Voting experience
Player screens display:
                           * A list of player names with selectable cards

                           * Tap one → it highlights

                           * Tap Submit

                           * UI becomes locked and shows “Waiting for others…”

Host screen:
                              * Optionally displays vote progress (“4/7 votes submitted”)

                              * Does not show actual votes until the reveal

This should feel snappy, clear, and fair.

🎉 6. Dramatic reveal & results
The host screen is the main spectacle here.
It should show:
Step 1
“You voted out: [Player Name]”
 – Big bold animation (fade-in, pop, or card flip)
Step 2
Reveal if the eliminated player was an Imposter:
                                 * Green if correct

                                 * Red if wrong

Step 3
Show whether the game ends:
                                    * “Civilians Win!”

                                    * or “Imposters Win!”

                                    * or “Continue to next round” (if using multi-round mode)

Player screens also get a clean summary.
This phase should feel fun, suspenseful, and satisfying.

Target Visual Style
Here’s what the app should broadly look like:
Clean + Bold + Playful
                                       * Similar to Kahoot or Jackbox branding

                                       * Big typography

                                       * High contrast

                                       * Simple shapes & cards (no clutter)

Dynamic
                                          * Smooth animations (fade, slide, scale)

                                          * Real-time updates

Device-Friendly
                                             * Player UI fits perfectly on mobile (thumb-accessible buttons)

                                             * Host UI works well on desktop/TV
